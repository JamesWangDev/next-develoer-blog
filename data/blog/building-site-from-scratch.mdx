Just a couple months ago I gave my website a redesign, and since then I've been silently pushing updates to it while also building it from scratch

#### Why?

**Why not?** Actually, yeah, there might be reasons to not build it from scratch, but as the website growed and I needed to update components and
stuff, I was feeling overwhelmed by how it was organized.

So I think an update was due, but I didn't want to work on top of the mess that I had, so I decided to start from scratch.

As I keep learning new tools, frameworks and libraries, I keep finding room for improvements to my existing projects, but overall for the one that
I find the most important: this website.

Let me walk you through the changes and updates I've done to this website during the last couple months...

## What changed?

#### CSS modules → Styled Components → Tailwind

I had CSS modules for every single component in my website. This was ok but I started noticing that my CSS code was frequently being duplicated
as I kept using it in another _(similar)_ components.

So, as I recently learnt about using Styled Components, specifically with [emotion.sh](https://emotion.sh/), I saw that as an opportunity to use
it and be able to create components that extended from other components, so that I didn't need to rewrite styles for all, but just override them
if needed.

I used this for a while, and everything was working pretty good. Anyways, about a week ago, I decided to give
[tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.com/) a try.
I honestly don't like it much for a specific reason: the `class` attribute in `html` code is way too long and I don't like that.

So I started to look around on ways to use and learn about tailwind, while keeping a styled components syntax. And that's when I found
[`twin.macro`](https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro). It allows to take advantage of all the classes and utilities from tailwind, while
writing components like you would with styled components.

The syntax is pretty simple and the code will be short. Plus, it compiles the tailwind classes into css with styled components, so the generated html
is as clean as it can be.

Here's an example for a styled link with `twin.macro`:

```typescript:src/components/link.tsx
import tw from 'twin.macro';

const StyledLink = tw.a`
  font-medium
  inline-block
  text-accent
  hocus:(text-accent-dark dark:text-accent-light)
`;
```

It also comes with a lot of utilities to write less code, like `hocus` so you can style `hover` and `focus` at the same time. O rbeing able to
write css directly within the `tw` string, like

`--custom-color[#4285f4]`

It's pretty powerful to be honest. And now I put both tailwind and styled components into practice, while reducing a lot of code in my website.
You can check a [recent Pull Request](https://github.com/jahirfiquitiva/jahir.dev/pull/6) I did for this. The difference is huge.

#### Adios, localization

I had localization setup in my previous website for a while. I wanted it to be available for Spanish speakers too (which is my native language),
but maintaining content in both languages, especially for blog posts, was a lot of work and time spent, and I didn't really have the will to do
that.

It was disabled a while ago in that website, but now is completely gone.

#### No more plain, simple and boring Markdown

For a long while, I was using simple markdown for my blog posts, but as I wanted to build simple pages without having to write a lot of react code,
I noticed that I was really missing on the features MDX offered, and decided it was time to give it a try.

[Lee Rob](https://leerob.io)'s website has always been a reference for mine, and its blog is built using MDX. When I checked the source code to learn how it
was doing MDX and handling it with NextJS, I noticed he uses [contentlayer](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer) which transforms simple
content into data, like JavaScript objects and arrays, even typed, so that it's easy to use within your site.

It's also pretty flexible as it allows transforming fields or creating new ones.

All of that, has made me like MDX a lot and made the transition super easy, and also even allowed to easily setup an [RSS feed](https://jahir.dev/feed.xml)
for my website.

## What's new?

Everything!
